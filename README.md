**🗣️💊 Speech-to-Text in Healthcare Project**

This project focuses on converting doctor-patient dialogues into structured text using speech-to-text technology.
The system aims to improve clinical documentation, reduce errors, and save time for healthcare professionals, ultimately enhancing the quality of patient care.

**📚 Project Overview**

Healthcare generates large volumes of unstructured data through doctor-patient interactions. Manual documentation is often time-consuming and error-prone, leading to administrative burden and reduced patient care time.

This project leverages automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to:

Transcribe doctor-patient conversations in real time.

Provide structured medical notes for electronic health records (EHRs).

Support faster, more accurate clinical documentation.

**🎯 Features**

🎙️ Real-time Speech-to-Text Conversion of clinical conversations.

📄 Automatic Generation of Medical Notes for EHR integration.

🔍 Entity Recognition for symptoms, diseases, and medications.

🩺 Speaker Differentiation (doctor vs. patient) for clarity.

📊 Analytics Dashboard to visualize conversation patterns.

🔒 Data Privacy & Security ensuring compliance with healthcare standards (HIPAA/GDPR-ready).

**🔧 Technologies Used**

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

Speech Recognition: Google Speech-to-Text API / Vosk / Whisper

NLP: spaCy, NLTK, Transformers (BERT, BioBERT)

Data Visualization: Plotly, Dash, IBM Cognos, or Power BI

Database: MySQL / MongoDB

Deployment: Flask / Django / FastAPI, Docker, Cloud Hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)

**🔍 Usage**

Once the system is up and running, users can:

Record or upload doctor-patient audio conversations.

Convert them into transcribed text automatically.

Extract key medical entities (diseases, symptoms, drugs).

Generate structured notes ready for integration with hospital EHR systems.

Use the dashboard to analyze patient flow, communication patterns, and documentation trends.
